                    <p class="mb-30">So, for my revised piece of writing, I continued writing my personal narrative because I didn't completely finish it.
                       I had high hopes that I would finish it this time, but I did not get there. I actually enjoy writing it, I just have run out of time.
                        So, without further interuptions, I present ON BROADWAY</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">It begins on a dark stage. When the yellow and orange hues at dawn rise behind the buildings of New York City at the turn
                       of the twentieth century, Jack Kelly wakes up on the roof of the lodging house for another day of selling newspapers. When his best friend
                        Crutchie wakes up as well, Jack tells him of his aspirations of moving to Santa Fe where, as he says, “It’s clean and green and pretty and
                         they went and made a city outta clay”. He wants a better life, where he isn’t treated like the dirt on people’s shoes. I think at one point
                          in our lives we can all relate to Jack. We either want what we don’t have or we want to become something more.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">As he savors the last few moments of peace, you hear the wake-up belling ringing down below, as his fellow newsboys start to go
                      about their day. The ragtag group of friends make their way to the distribution center, the place where they get their newspapers. While buying
                      their “papes” for the day from Wiesel, also known as “Weasel”, two newcomers appear. Unlike the rest of the newsies, Davey and Les have a family
                      and a home. They came to work after their father, who was injured in a factory incident, was fired. Jack makes a deal to help them sell, seeing
                      Les as an opportunity to sell more papers.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">Meanwhile, while the newsies go off to sell their papers, Joseph Pulitzer, the publisher of the New York World, meets with his staff.
                       Expressing his disappointment at the decline of sales because of the end of the Spanish-American War, he listens to suggestions on how to bring
                       more money in. When his bookkeeper suggests to raise the price to the newsies, from 50 cents to 60 cents for a hundred newspapers, Pulitzer
                       determines that the price will go up the next morning. After a long day of selling papers, Davey invites Jack over to his family’s place for dinner.
                        After Jack explains that he has plans (which he doesn’t really), Les asks “Is that the guy you’re meeting?” about the shadowy figure eyeing them down
                         the street. Jack starts running and the boys follow after him, not wanting to be caught by the suspicious figure. One safely inside of a theatre,
                         Jack explains that the man who was chasing them is called “Snyder the Spider”. He is the warden of the Refuge, a jail for kids.</p>
